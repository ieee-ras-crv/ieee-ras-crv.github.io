In recent years, the field of computer & robot vision has seen several significant advancements. Here are the top three:

1. **Deep Learning for Semantic Understanding:** Deep learning has revolutionized the ability of computers and robots to understand and interpret visual data at a semantic level. Leveraging large datasets and the computational power of GPUs, deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based architectures, have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks.

2. **Factor Graph Optimization for Visual-Inertial Odometry and SLAM:** Factor graph optimization has become a cornerstone in the development of robust visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. This approach models the problem as a graph where nodes represent states (e.g., robot poses) and edges represent constraints (e.g., measurements). Factor graph optimizaition has significantly advanced probabilistic inference, optimization on manifolds with application to VIO and SLAM.


3. **Advanced Map Representations:** The development of advanced map representations has greatly enhanced the ability of robots to understand and navigate complex environments. These representations, including voxel grids, meshes and scene graphs, enable efficient storage, manipulation, and querying of spatial information. Emerging techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and Gaussian splatting represent scenes with continuous volumetric fields or point-based representations that encode spatial and appearance information. These methods enable high-quality 3D reconstructions and novel view synthesis, pushing the boundaries of visual understanding and rendering.

These advancements have propelled the capabilities of computer & robot vision, enabling more sophisticated and practical applications across different sectors.
