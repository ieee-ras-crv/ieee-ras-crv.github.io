The [IEEE Robotics and Automation Society](https://www.ieee-ras.org) is taking steps to incorporate the Technical Committees (TCs) into existing IEEE infrastructure and improve the data privacy options. This will allow for easier management, communication, and organization.

From now on, you can become a member of the IEEE TC on Computer & Robot Vision by going to the [IEEE Membership catalog](https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=CMYRAS021&tcType=IEEE%20Robotics%20and%20Automation%20Society%20Membership&searchResults=Y) and checking out our TC. All you will need is a free IEEE Account, **an IEEE membership is NOT required, and joining our TC is free.**

If you are a current member enrolled via previous smart sheet, please re-register to our TC through the new system.
